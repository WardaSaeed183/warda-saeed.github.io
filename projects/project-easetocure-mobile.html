                <h2>The Challenge: A Rapid Build</h2>
                <p>The goal was to extend the EaseToCure ecosystem with a personalized mobile experience. I challenged myself to build a fully functional, cross-platform mobile app from scratch as a sole developer. The key constraint was time: the entire process, from initial setup to final Firebase integration, was completed in an intensive three-day sprint (approx. 24 working hours).</p>

                <h3>My Role & Contributions</h3>
                <p>As the sole developer, I was responsible for every aspect of the application's lifecycle:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>UI/UX Design & Development:</strong> Designed and built all user interfaces using Flutter, focusing on a clean and intuitive user experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend Integration:</strong> Set up and configured a new Firebase project, including Firestore for the database and Firebase Authentication for user management.</li>
                    <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Implemented a robust state management solution to handle real-time data flow between the app and the backend.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Development:</strong> Coded all core features, including the BMI calculator, the BP/Sugar logs, and the data history management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Tooling:</strong> Leveraged modern development tools, including AI assistants, to accelerate the coding process, debug issues, and ensure rapid progress without sacrificing code quality.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Challenges & Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>This project was a powerful exercise in speed, efficiency, and full-stack ownership. The main challenge was architecting the entire application quickly while ensuring the foundation was scalable. Relying on tools like AI assistants for boilerplate code and debugging allowed me to focus on the core logic and user experience. This rapid prototyping sprint proved my ability to quickly learn, adapt, and deliver a complete, data-driven product under a tight deadline.</p>
