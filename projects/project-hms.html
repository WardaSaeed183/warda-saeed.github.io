                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>Hotels require a robust and reliable system to manage a constant flow of data related to guests, rooms, and services. The objective of this project was to design and implement a normalized SQL database from the ground up, creating a scalable backend capable of handling all core hotel operations, from booking and check-in to final billing.</p>

                <h3>Project Context</h3>
                <p>This was a semester-long database project developed in a team of two. My partner, Muaarij, and I collaborated closely on all aspects of the design and implementation, ensuring the final product was both functionally complete and well-architected for our final grades.</p>
            </section>

                <h3>Our Collaborative Contributions</h3>
                <p>We shared the workload equally, tackling key challenges together:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Database Design & ERD:</strong> We jointly designed the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), mapping out all tables and their relationships to accurately model hotel operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Schema Implementation:</strong> We both worked on writing the SQL DDL scripts to create the tables, constraints, and indexes in Microsoft SQL Server, ensuring data integrity through proper normalization (3NF).</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend Logic (Stored Procedures):</strong> We divided the work of writing the core stored procedures. I focused on the procedures for billing and room service charges, while my partner handled room booking and availability checks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing & Data Population:</strong> We collaboratively created test data and ran queries to validate that our database functioned correctly under various scenarios.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Challenges & Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>Working in a pair on a complex database design was a fantastic learning experience in communication and shared ownership. The main technical challenge was ensuring our schema was perfectly normalized to prevent data anomalies while still being efficient for complex queries. This project provided a deep, practical understanding of how a well-designed database serves as the critical foundation for any successful application.</p>
