                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Finding understandable and relevant information about medicines online is a significant challenge. Patients and caregivers are often confronted with dense medical jargon, making it difficult to quickly grasp essential details. This information overload can lead to confusion and anxiety, highlighting the need for a simpler, more user-friendly solution.</p>

                <h3>Project Context</h3>
                <p>This was a semester-long group project built by a team of four members. As the team lead, I was responsible for task delegation, backend architecture, and ensuring the final integration resulted in a cohesive and high-quality product that met our academic requirements.</p>

                <h3>My Role & Contributions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Team Leadership & Backend Architecture:</strong> I led the project, assigned tasks to each team member, and designed the complete backend using Firebase for authentication and Firestore for real-time data management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Core Backend Implementation:</strong> I personally developed the Firebase functions and security rules to handle all data related to medicines and user accounts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration & Optimization:</strong> After individual components were completed by team members, I merged all parts of the project, optimized the codebase by removing redundancies, and linked the entire front-end to the backend services I had built.</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical UI/UX Overhaul & Feature Implementation:</strong> Recognizing that key screens needed refinement to meet project standards, I took initiative to rebuild and enhance several critical components overnight. This included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Redesigning the Medicine Details, Search by Category, and Search by Disease screens.</li>
                            <li>Implementing universal search functionality across the application.</li>
                            <li>Adding the "Forgot Password" feature and search suggestions on the homepage.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h2>Challenges & Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>Leading the team while also being a core developer was a significant challenge that taught me invaluable lessons in project management and communication. The most critical moment was stepping in to overhaul key UI components under a tight deadline. This experience reinforced the importance of taking ownership to ensure the final product's quality and the team's collective success. Technically, it was a deep dive into full-stack development, from architecting a secure backend with Firebase to ensuring a seamless and performant front-end experience.</p>
