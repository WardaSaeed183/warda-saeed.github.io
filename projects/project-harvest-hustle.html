                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>The primary objective of this project was to apply and implement fundamental data structures from scratch in a practical context. The challenge was to architect a console-based game using Trees and Linked Lists to manage core logic like level progression, scoring, and dynamic item generation.</p>

                <h3>Project Context</h3>
                <p>This was a semester project developed with excellent teamwork by a group of three. We collaborated closely on all phases, from initial design to final implementation, ensuring a successful and functional result.</p>

                <h3>My Role & Contributions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linked List Implementation:</strong> I took ownership of implementing the Linked List data structure from scratch in C++. This structure was used to efficiently manage the randomly generated fruits and obstacles appearing on screen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game Loop & Scoring Logic:</strong> I designed and coded the main game loop, which included the logic for player scoring, handling user input, and triggering "game over" conditions when negative-point items were collected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborative Algorithm Design:</strong> I worked with my teammates to design the Tree structure used for managing the game's difficulty levels and overall progression.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Challenges & Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>The most insightful challenge was implementing the Tree and Linked List data structures manually in C++ without relying on standard libraries. This forced a deep understanding of pointers, memory management, and node traversal. Collaborating effectively as a team to debug complex algorithmic issues was a fantastic experience in communication and shared problem-solving. This project was invaluable for bridging the gap between theoretical computer science concepts and their practical application.</p>
